Deep dives into interesting subjects.

I'm Sean Dermody and I currently am a 4th year statistics and economics student hoping to become a sports data analyst in the future. Currently I work for UVA Baseball and am in the process of helping UVA win the College World Series in 2026. On the side I also analyze MLB pitch and player data to gain insights into the baseball world. As of January 2026, I have only one project involving Adley Rutschman's talks with the Orioles about his future. But, there will be more information to look at soon.

## Adley Rutschman Case Study
Rutschman will be 28 years old when the 2026 season starts, but a lot of questions remain about how much of a long-term option he will be for the Orioles. He is in his 2nd year of arbitration, and will be looking for market value if signing a long-term deal. The Orioles on the other hand, just signed their top catcher prospect Basallo for 8 years, sparking lots of concerns about the future of Adley Rutschman in Birdland.
